# Graphs

A **graph** is a way of representing relationships that exist between
pairs of objects.

A graph is a set of objects, called vertices, together with a collection of
pairwise connections between them, called edges.


A **graph** G is simply a set V of **vertices** and a collection E
of pairs of vertices from V , called **edges**.

Alternative names: **nodes** and **arcs**.


#### Edges (u,v)

- directed (with u preceding v - ordered)
  - asymmetric relation (one direction)
- undirected (not ordered)
  - symmetric relation (both directions)

Accordingly, undirected graph, directed graph (digraph) or mixed graph
if all edges are undirected, directed or both.

#### Vertices

- End vertices (endpoints)
  - origin
  - destination
- Adjacent
- Incident
- Outgoing edges
- Incoming edges
- Degree of vertex, deg(v)
  - in-degree, indeg(v)
  - out-degree, outdeg(v)
